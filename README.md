**The first version (1.0) is quite simple, includes 3 main features:**

1. The ScrumBoard: based on another Redmine plugin with a board, but we completed more features, allow teams could treat like a REAL BOARD.
Users could drad and drop a task to sort/organizate the Sprint.
2. The ListBoard: list all issues based on the sort from ScrumBoard and make it more simple than Issue Tracking in Redmine.
3. The interface of screens based on Twitter Bootstrap, with better look and feeling.
